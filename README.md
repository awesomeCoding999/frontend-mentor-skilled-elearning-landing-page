## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- mobile first design

### What I learned

I learned a lot about absolute position and layouts for different screen sizes in this challenge. I ran into some challenges with the larger design layouts, so that is something that I will need to continue to work on.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks Complete guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I think this is the best guide to understanding Flexbox.
